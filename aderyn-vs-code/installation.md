# Installation

1. Install Aderyn via the VS Code Marketplace ADD LINK
2. Visit the Welcome page (Aderyn will open this in your IDE)
3. Aderyn will start looking for vulnerabilities in your codebase.

Aderyn works seamlessly on commonly recognized project structures, i.e. when a foundry.toml or hardhat.config.ts or aderyn.toml is found in the workspace's root.
